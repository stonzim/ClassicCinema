                    <p>The Harbour Hotel, is situated on the Otago Peninsula, and as such, offers a fantastic view of
                        the beautiful Otago Harbour. We are only a short distance from Lanarch Castle and Glenfalloch
                        Gardens, beaches and other beautiful areas of forestry. Otago Peninsula is also home to some
                        of New Zealand's most iconic wildlife, such as the Royal Albatross and the Yellow Eyed Penguin.
